# Chessboard and Chess AI

Partway through... so far what I've done is largely following a tutorial, but the chessboard itself is funcational save for a few bugs e.g. can castle through check.

Still need to add functionalities like premoves, and an AI component in the future!

Current functionalities of Chessboard:

1. Pressing T changes the Theme of the board 

2. Pressing R resets the board

Current posssible moves are highlighted 

Previous move made is highlighted too

For future implementation:
1. Make code cleaner
2. Debug mistakes like castling through check
3. Adding AI functionality
4. Addding other features like premoves, undo moves

Hope you enjoy :D
