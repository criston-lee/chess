# Chessboard and Chess AI

Partway through... so far what I've done is largely following a tutorial, but the chessboard itself is funcational save for a few bugs e.g. can castle through check.

Still need to add functionalities like premoves, and an AI component in the future!

Current functionalities of Chessboard:

Pressing T changes the Theme of the board 
Pressing R resets the board
