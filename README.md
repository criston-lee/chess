# Chessboard and Chess AI

Partway through... so far what I've done is largely following a tutorial, but the chessboard itself is funcational.

Still need to add functionalities like premoves, and an AI component in the future!

Current functionalities of Chessboard:

1. Pressing T changes the Theme of the board 

2. Pressing R resets the board

For future implementation:
1. Adding AI functionality Properly (Code doesn't really run beyond depth 1, and runs slowly)
2. Addding other features like premoves, undo moves, stalemate / 3 move repetition functionality

Hope you enjoy :D
